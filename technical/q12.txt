Define method overloading and method overriding.

overloading:- defining multiple methods with the same name within a class but with different parameters
for exampl >>
not that python doesn't support overloading like other language c++ , java, usually achieved through the use of default argument values
 
class Smart:
    def calc(self,num1,num2=None):
        return num1 + num2  if num2 else num1

    
    
overriding >> subclass providing a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, the method in the subclass must have the same name
for exampl >>
class Car:
    def move(self):
        print("The car is moving now!")

class Boate:
    def move(self):
        print("The boat is sailing now")
