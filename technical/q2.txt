What different types of model inheritance are used in Odoo 16?

in odoo 16 there are three types of model inheritance:-
  
  1- classical inheritance:
  	in this type we don't need to use the _name attribute with _inherit attribute because the _name of the parent is a default
  	this type update the parent table without create a new one in the database	
  
  2- prototype inheritance:
  	we use the _name attribute with _inherit attribute
  	this type create a new table in the database
  	
  3- delegation inheritance:
  	- in this type we use the _ inherits attribute to create a synchronous relation between the parent and the child(Many2one)
  	- the child can inherit from multiple models
  	- if a new record created in the child its automatically created in the parent
